### Useful resources

- [Bem Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This helped me understand how to structure my CSS in a scalable and maintainable way. I really liked this naming convention because it keeps styles organized and avoids conflicts.
- [How to get rid of the gap under the image ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/how-to-get-rid-of-the-gap-under-the-image/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) - This article helped me finally understand why images sometimes leave a small gap underneath in HTML layouts. It explains the default inline behavior of images and how to fix it using CSS properties like `display: block` or vertical-align. Very helpful for layout troubleshooting.
- [::before Pseudoelement](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/::before) - A comprehensive guide to the ::before pseudo-element, which allows you to insert content before an element without modifying the HTML. Very useful for adding decorative elements or icons purely with CSS.
- [A new way to animate display: none](https://dev.to/kevinbism/css-animation-with-display-none-4pan) - Explains a clever technique to animate elements even when they are toggled with `display: none`. It helped me create smoother transitions and understand CSS animation tricks.
- [@starting-style property CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) - Provides insight into the `@starting-style` CSS property for defining initial style conditions. Useful for controlling animations and initial states in a more predictable way.
